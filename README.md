## Low-level programming & Algorithm

This repository is my very first experience coding with the masterclass, C programming language

- This repository is the core learning material covered in the probation and first trimester of the ALX Full Stack Software Engineering program.

------------------------------------------------------

## Description

The C programming language, developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1972 at Bell Laboratories, is a low-level language oriented to the implementation of operating systems (Unix), compilers and software development. It is useful, versatile, powerful and complex, so it can be used in any operating system or hardware.

## **Compilation**

To compile a file with the function is necessary to add all the .c files involved in the program (functions, signature files, etc). Codes will be compiled this way:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o name_of_executable

```

To execute:  `./name_of_executable`
